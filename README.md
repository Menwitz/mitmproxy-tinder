Tinder MITM Proxy
This project implements a custom MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) proxy using mitmproxy. It is designed to intercept Tinder API requests and modify geolocation data—specifically replacing latitude and longitude values with those for Williamsburg, Brooklyn—while passing all other traffic unmodified.

Features
Selective Interception:
Targets requests to the Tinder API (e.g., those containing api.gotinder.com in the URL).

Geolocation Modification:
Intercepts JSON payloads in POST requests and replaces geolocation data:

Latitude: 40.7081
Longitude: -73.9571
Verbose Logging:
Logs intercepted requests and details of modifications for debugging.

HTTPS Support:
Works with HTTPS traffic by using mitmproxy’s certificate generation and installation mechanism.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
mitmproxy (install via pip)
Basic familiarity with proxy configuration and Android certificate installation
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tinder-mitm-proxy.git
cd tinder-mitm-proxy
Install mitmproxy:

bash
Copy
pip install mitmproxy
Setup
Generate and Install the mitmproxy Certificate on Android
Generate the Certificate:
Run mitmproxy for the first time. It automatically creates a root certificate (typically located at ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem).

Convert the Certificate to DER Format:
Android devices require the certificate in DER format. Run:

bash
Copy
openssl x509 -in ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem -outform DER -out mitmproxy-ca-cert.der
Install the Certificate on Your Android Device:

Transfer the mitmproxy-ca-cert.der file to your Android device.
Navigate to Settings > Security > Install from storage and follow the prompts to install the certificate as a trusted root.
Configure Your Android Device to Use the Proxy
Connect to the Same Network:
Ensure your Android device is on the same Wi-Fi network as the machine running mitmproxy.

Set Up the Proxy:

In your Wi-Fi settings, configure the manual proxy:
Proxy Host: The IP address of your mitmproxy host (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
Proxy Port: 8080
Running the Proxy
Launch mitmproxy (or mitmweb) with the custom script:

bash
Copy
mitmproxy --listen-host 0.0.0.0 -p 8080 -vv -s tinder_proxy.py
The --listen-host 0.0.0.0 flag allows connections from external devices.
The -vv flag increases verbosity, which is useful for debugging.
How It Works
Interception:
The script intercepts HTTP(S) requests directed to Tinder’s API by filtering URLs containing api.gotinder.com.

Geolocation Update:
For POST requests with JSON payloads that contain geolocation keys (e.g., "lat" and "lon"), the script:

Parses the JSON payload.
Replaces the geolocation values with those for Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
Logs the original and modified values.
Pass-through for Other Traffic:
All other requests are passed through unmodified.

Troubleshooting
No Intercepted Traffic:

Verify that your Android device is configured with the correct proxy host (the actual IP, not localhost).
Ensure that mitmproxy is started with the --listen-host 0.0.0.0 option.
Check that there are no firewall rules or network restrictions blocking the connection.
Tinder Reports No Network Connection:

Ensure the JSON payload structure matches what the script expects. Tinder may use nested keys or different identifiers for geolocation.
Confirm that the certificate is properly installed and trusted on your device.
Local Traffic Issues:

Some local processes (e.g., system services) might generate traffic directed at localhost:8080. Test using an external device to isolate traffic.
For more detailed troubleshooting, review the verbose logs generated by mitmproxy and compare them with expected request/response cycles.
